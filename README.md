# Data-Science-Projects-CODESOFT-

Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

Task 1: Titanic Survival Detection
  This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data 
  analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction 
  In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the 
  development of a machine learning model to predict movie ratings.

Task 3: Iris Flower  Dataset
  The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers 
  into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Task 4: Sales Prediction 
  This project focuses on predicting sales for a business. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of 
  a predictive model to forecast future sales.

Conclusion:
  The Codsoft Data Science Internship has been an enriching experience, providing me with the skills and knowledge to tackle real-world data 
  challenges. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects and look forward to applying these skills in future 
  endeavors.
